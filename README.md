# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE RESTAURANT DATASET
The restaurant analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the  operational efficiency, customer behavior, and financial performance of their partnered restaurants. Particular attention is given to identifying the top-performing restaurants in terms of revenue generation, as well as those with higher occurrences of canceled orders.
