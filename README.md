# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF WALMART SALES DATASET
The analysis focuses on sales data from Walmart stores across three cities: Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. The dataset provides insight into customer demographics, product lines, payment methods, and sales trends. The primary objectives are to understand city-wise sales performance, product line revenue contributions, payment preferences, and spending behavior based on gender. By using SQL queries and visualizations, we uncovered key trends, such as the leading product lines and cities in terms of sales, and the distribution of payment methods.
